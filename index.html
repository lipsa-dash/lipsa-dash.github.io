    On land, temperatures have risen about twice as fast as the global average. 
    Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[5] 
    Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, 
    glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[6] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms and other weather extremes.[7] 
    In places such as coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic, many species are forced to relocate or become extinct,
    as their environment changes.[8] Climate change threatens people with food and water scarcity, increased flooding, 
    extreme heat, more disease, and economic loss. It can also drive human migration.[9]
    The World Health Organization calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.[10]
    Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include sea level rise, 
    and warmer, more acidic oceans.[11]
